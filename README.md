# Courier Service

This tool checks your RSS feed for any new additions, and sends out emails accordingly.

## Usage
Enter the Buttondown dashboard and select `"Programming"`. Your API key will the first item on the page. Set this as an environment variables called `BUTTONDOWN_KEY`. You can tell Courier Service to send emails itself, rather than "cache" it for manual approval by using the `COURIER_DIRECT` variable and setting it to `true`.

Run the tool everytime a Git push is made with a Git hook or by some other recurring request to ensure Courier Service can see changes as they come: `./courier-service https://maatt.ch/atom.xml`
